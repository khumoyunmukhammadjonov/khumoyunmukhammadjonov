ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a university student and I absolutely love to code! ðŸ’» It's my passion and I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning different programming languages.

One of my favorite areas of focus is front-end development, and I'm proud to say that I'm a self-taught front-end developer! ðŸ™Œ I've spent countless hours studying and practicing to become proficient in creating beautiful, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Sass.

It's amazing to see how coding can bring a website to life, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges to help me grow as a developer. Whether it's designing a sleek new layout or writing complex code to make a website function smoothly, I find great satisfaction in every aspect of the process.

Thanks for reading a bit about me and my journey as a front-end developer! ðŸ˜Š
